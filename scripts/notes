each task should have its own stack pointer, important
each mode will have their own stacks 

1. when switching mode, manually, spsr will not change ->verify



2. Schedule can be called in

irq, system, svc

when in irq, system or svc will not occur
When in svc, irqs are disabled, so schedule will not be called
When in sys, irq timer will be called and schedule, so disable irqs when entering schedule function in "sys mode"
